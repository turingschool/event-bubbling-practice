# Event Bubbling Practice

This project currently allows a user to add an `Adorable Dog` to the list. Each `Adorable Dog` name appears on a card, with a heart icon and a trash can icon.

Implement the code necessary to allow a user to favorite a card by clicking the heart icon (indicated by a filled in heart) or remove a card by clicking the trash can icon.

Filled in heart icon address: http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/designbolts/free-valentine-heart/256/Heart-icon.png
